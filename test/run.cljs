  "Smoke for the ClojureScript facade.

  This file previously required `kotobase.core`, a namespace that does not
  exist -- so it could not load, let alone pass. It had been dead since the
  rename, and with no CI nothing said so. That matters more than a stale
  import usually would: `kotobase.engine` has a `.clj` and a `.cljs`
  implementation, the JVM suite covers only the first, and the second is
  the one every Worker deployment runs.

  Kept deliberately small. It is a smoke test for the async facade -- open,
  transact, read the published ref, query it back -- not a second copy of
  the JVM suite. The storage backends carry the deep round trips against
  their own stores."
